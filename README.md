## Story

A player walks into a mysterious arcade store and discovers an old, dusty arcade machine. On its screen glows a mask with a single warning:

> **"Don't click me."**

Driven by curiosity, the player interacts with it — and is suddenly pulled into a strange and dangerous world.

Trapped inside this realm, the player must survive against hostile enemies while exploring different levels. Throughout the journey, the player collects **magical masks**, each granting unique abilities that change gameplay and unlock new strategies. Mastering these powers becomes essential to progressing through increasingly challenging environments.

In the final stage, the player faces a **powerful boss battle** that tests all the abilities gained along the way. After defeating the boss, the player returns to the real world, only to find the arcade machine old and lifeless — leaving a lingering question about whether the adventure truly happened.
